# TODO

- Adding loading state to `useUserMetadata` so views can show loading state
- Add a debounce to user metadata services so it dose not spam the relay when updating subscription
- user metadata service: remove author from subscription once metadata is returned
- create a stats page showing state of local db and info about app
- create user timeline service that caching events and supports loading older events on request

## Ideas

- come up with a clever name
- build support for DMs
